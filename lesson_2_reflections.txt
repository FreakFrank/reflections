What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	- A new empty repo is initialized with some .git files.
	- So I can start commiting to this repo which I will be having my project saved on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	- The working area is the place where I'm changing my code, while the staging area is where I'm putting some files to be commited.
	- I think it add the value of commiting multiple files at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	- We can use the git diff --staged command to compare with the most recent commit and make sure that we have only changed one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	- If I want to have different versions of my code concurrently, or if I'm making something different than the previous piece of codes(New feature, fixing bug)., also for experimnts.
